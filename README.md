# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project can be used by managers at all levels who want to build teams and have key information easily accessible to them. Add engineers or interns to your team and you will be able to see their employee ID along with their email address. Clicking on the email address will open up your email application with the employees email already filled in. 

Each employee type receives their own special field. Managers receive their office number within their card. While engineers show their github account with a link to their profile. Lastly, the interns card displays the school they are/did attend.
